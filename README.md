# Route Optimizer - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

## Project Overview
This Route Optimizer is designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), aiming to find the shortest possible route that allows a user to visit a given set of locations exactly once and return to the starting point. By optimizing the path, this tool minimizes the total travel distance, providing an efficient solution for logistics and planning applications.

## Features
- Solves the TSP using optimization algorithms
- Outputs the most efficient route for a set of locations
- Calculates and minimizes total travel distance
- Returns to the starting location at the end of the route

## Installation
To get started with the Route Optimizer, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/route-optimizer.git
cd route-optimizer
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the Route Optimizer, provide the locations and start the application:
```bash
node index.js
```
Replace index.js with the main file name if different.

## Example
To run the Route Optimizer, provide the locations and start the application:
```javascript
const locations = [
    { name: "Location 1", latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437 },
    { name: "Location 2", latitude: 36.1699, longitude: -115.1398 },
    { name: "Location 3", latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 }
];

const optimizedRoute = optimizeRoute(locations);
console.log("Optimized Route:", optimizedRoute);
```

## Configuration
- Ensure the locations are provided with accurate latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Customize distance calculation methods as needed for different metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Haversine).
